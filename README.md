# Assignment01 Explanation

For the hybrid sort I decided to do a combination of merge and insertion sort. I got some inspiration and tried following along with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFHVe5MT6o

The video explains a hybrid program in python and I tried to do a java version. I chose to do insertion sort for the inplace sorting sicne the best case is O(n) and so I tried to incorporate that in my program somehow. If the run is small then use insertion sort (not sure if I implemented that correctly however). I used that with merge sort in order to merge the two smaller sorted lists.
